Phase 1 Project Update (120+ mins)
😈Project Title: Simple CLI Text Processor (Finalizing the design)
😈Goal: Make the CLI tool robust by handling files and flags.
😈Today's Task:
😈Input Handling: Implement the use of the flag package (or the simpler os.Args) to accept two command-line arguments: an input file path and an output file path.
😈File Processing: Use the os and io packages to read the content of the input file.
😈Apply the processing logic (like uppercasing or reversing, using the strings package) to the file content.
😈Write the final processed content to the specified output file path.
