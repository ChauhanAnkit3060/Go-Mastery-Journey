Excellent! That is a major milestone achieved. Completing the Channels and Goroutines exercise means you've successfully wrestled with Go's most distinctive and powerful feature: its concurrency model. You've now completed all the planned foundational learning for Phase 1.

It is now Saturday, November 29th, 2025. Today is a high-intensity, project-building day (3-5 hours).

🏗️ Saturday Plan: Phase 1 Project Finalization
Today, we transition from scattered exercises to a cohesive, documented project. This CLI tool will be the first entry in your job portfolio.

🎯 Saturday Focus: Finishing the CLI Text Processor
Your CLI tool should now be capable of reading an input file, performing an operation (like Uppercase, Reverse, or maybe even simple word count), and writing the output to a specified file.

1. Project Integration (120 mins)
Goal: Connect all the dots from the past week: Structs, Functions, File I/O, and Command-Line Input.

Tasks:

Refactoring: Review your code. Ensure function names are clear (e.g., ProcessFile rather than pf). Use short variable names within functions, but descriptive names for package-level variables and structs.

Error Handling: Go through every file read/write operation and check for errors using the if err != nil idiom. Make sure the program exits gracefully if a file is not found.

Configuration: Solidify the use of the flag package to accept command-line arguments (e.g., -input file.txt, -output result.txt, -op uppercase).

Usage: Run your tool from the terminal with various inputs to ensure it works as expected.

2. Documentation and Portfolio Ready (90 mins)
A project isn't finished until it's documented. This shows employers you're professional.

README.md: Write a clean, professional README.md for the project. It must include:

What it does. (A single paragraph description)

How to Install/Build. (Simple go build steps)

How to Use. (Example command-line usage: ./cli-tool -input data.txt -op reverse)

Go Concepts Used. (List the key concepts: Structs, Pointers, File I/O, flag package, Error Handling).

Final Commit: Make a final, clean commit to your GitHub repository titled: "Phase 1 Project Complete: CLI Text Processor."

⏭️ Transition to Phase 2: Planning
By the end of today, you will have completed Phase 1 (Foundation). Starting tomorrow, we shift to Phase 2 (Backend Development), where we apply Go to the real-world use case it dominates: HTTP Services and APIs.

Phase 2 Prep: Starting Tomorrow (Sunday)
The first topic will be the net/http package and building your first simple web server.

Your only commitment for today is to finish and document the CLI project. Send me a quick confirmation when the final commit is pushed to GitHub.

Great job on the first phase. The hard work begins now, where we turn knowledge into marketable skills!
