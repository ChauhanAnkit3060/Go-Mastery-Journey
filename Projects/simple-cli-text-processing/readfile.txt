Phase 1 Project Update (120+ mins)
Project Title: Simple CLI Text Processor (Finalizing the design)
Goal: Make the CLI tool robust by handling files and flags.
Today's Task:
Input Handling: Implement the use of the flag package (or the simpler os.Args) to accept two command-line arguments: an input file path and an output file path.
File Processing: Use the os and io packages to read the content of the input file.
Apply the processing logic (like uppercasing or reversing, using the strings package) to the file content.
Write the final processed content to the specified output file path.
